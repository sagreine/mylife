Horrific. My first non-HW coding project and first C# code. At times learning, at times just to enable functionality as I was using the application while developing it. Incredibly bad, and lots of borrowed code (at times unreferenced as well). Lots of unfinished or half-implemented ideas. Really fun though! Ostensibly an application to track and schedule work outs and dieting and allow for logging and reviewing progress, including imaging. Was my first exposure to SQLite and databases in applications.
